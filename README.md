## 💡 Why Veroma?

Most civic platforms are constrained by geography, bureaucracy, or politics. Veroma is different. It was built to be:

- 🌐 Borderless  
- 🗳️ Democratic  
- 👥 Inclusive  
- 💬 Community-driven  

Whether it’s fixing a broken streetlight or proposing a global climate resolution — every voice matters.
