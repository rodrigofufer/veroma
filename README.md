## 🧠 Tech Stack

  - React with TypeScript  
  - Tailwind CSS  
  - Supabase (Auth + Database)

  - Netlify (Deployment)  
  - Bolt.new (UI logic / builder)

## 🛠 Local Development

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your Supabase credentials:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-supabase-anon-key>
   ```
   If the login button stays on **"Signing in..."**, these environment variables are likely missing or incorrect.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## 💡 Why Veroma?

Most civic platforms are constrained by geography, bureaucracy, or politics. Veroma is different. It was built to be:

  - 🌐 Borderless  
  - 🗳️ Democratic  
  - 👥 Inclusive  
  - 💬 Community-driven  

Whether it's fixing a broken streetlight or proposing a global climate resolution — every voice matters.
